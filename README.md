### 💡 About Me
I'm a **Computer Systems Engineering student** at IPCA (Portugal) with international academic experience in **Austria** and **Macau**.  
At the moment, I'm focusing mainly on **Cybersecurity**, while also developing interest in **AI for Security** and data-driven approaches to privacy and digital wellbeing.

I enjoy understanding how systems fail, how networks behave, and how technology can be used to protect people and organizations.  
My goal is to build a solid foundation in security and gradually grow into areas where **AI and Cyber Defense** intersect.

### 🚀 What I’m Working On

Right now, I'm building a portfolio focused on Cybersecurity and practical learning:

- **🔎 Network-Defense-Lab** — network analysis, scanning, packet inspection  
- **📡 Threat-Detection-Lab** — anomaly detection experiments using ML  
- **🛡️ Cyber-Learning-Notes** — documentation of tools, commands and labs  

My plan is to grow these projects gradually with real practice:  
packet analysis, detections, python automation, and exploratory ML models.
